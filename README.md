# java-exercises

I'm solving some exercises inspired from the MOOC from the University of Helsinki's java course. Some of them will recall closely the ones that the exercises the course asks for, while others will have little in common with the original exercise.

In solving this exercises I'm using JDK 11.0.3, Maven 3.6.0 (in order to get used to it once I'll learn to build bigger projects) and VS Code as an IDE (planning to switch to NetBeans or Intellij in a couple of weeks).

## Exercises

* Name: this app displays my full name (learned to print on the terminal)
* Calculator: this app asks for 2 numbers and then for a method (one from sum, difference, multiplication, division), it will then display the result of the operation. (Used reflection to invoke the method instead of relying on conditional statements)
